🏠 AirBnB Data Analysis – Python 

This project explores and analyzes an Airbnb dataset to uncover insights about pricing, room types, neighborhoods, and review trends. The goal was to clean the raw data, handle inconsistencies, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand patterns that influence listings and customer engagement.

The analysis began with thorough data cleaning — handling missing values, removing duplicates, formatting date columns, eliminating unnecessary fields, and cleaning price-related columns by removing special characters. This ensured the dataset was structured, reliable, and ready for analysis.

Using Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization, I examined:

Distribution of listing prices

Room type availability and frequency

Neighborhood-wise listing distribution

Relationship between price and room type

Trends in number of reviews over time

Descriptive statistics for key variables

Key observations show that listing prices are fairly evenly distributed with no extreme spikes, room type significantly impacts pricing, and review trends provide insights into listing popularity and demand over time.

This project demonstrates practical skills in:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data visualization

Insight extraction from real-world datasets

Overall, this analysis reflects a structured approach to transforming raw data into meaningful insights that could help hosts optimize pricing strategies or guide customers in making informed booking decisions.
